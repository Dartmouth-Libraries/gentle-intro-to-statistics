# Gentle Introduction to Statistics

A gentle, low-code and low-math introduction to descriptive and inferential statistics in the context of machine learning.

## Session description
In this session, we will look at the fundamentals of statistics that will help us better understand the techniques described in the other two introductory sessions. You will gain (or refresh) knowledge on basic descriptive statistics, as well as probability distributions and what it all means for how AI sees the world.

This session is a great primer for the workshops on Classification and Regression later in the term.
